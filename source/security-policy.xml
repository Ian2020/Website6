  ImageMagick security policy.  By default any delegate, format, or file path
  is permitted.

  Suppose we do not want users to execute the ffmpeg delegate:

    <policy access="none" delegate="ffmpeg" />

  Here we do not want users reading images from HTTP:

    <policy access="none" format="http" />

  The /repository file system is restricted to read only. We use a glob
  expression to match all paths that start with /repository:
  
    <policy access="read" path="/repository/*" />
-->
<security-policy>
  <policy access="execute" delegate="*" />
  <policy access="read | write" format="*" />
  <policy access="read | write" path="*" />
</security-policy>
